# Photo Editor in Node.js

- The server was a ready Code from another person and I've used that server code for the server of this project and I have done all the other codes to create this project and to practice node.js, express, jade Template and shape library. Because of the server code, it's not legal to use the Code of this project for any other projects!

## Edit Images

By inserting the link of image, user can convert the format, apply color effect, rotate, resize and crop the image without login. After editing the image, the webpage provides two opportunities, link and download, to access the edited image. Sharp (Node.js image processing) is used in this project to edit images.
